A one way of learning restructured test is to start writing all of the things
down using rst. `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html>`_
is a rather nice static site generator.

A short tutorial on how to set up a blog with pelican, rst and github pages can be found
on `Circuidipity <http://www.circuidipity.com/pelican.html>`_.
